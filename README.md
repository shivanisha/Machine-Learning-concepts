## Machine-Learning-concepts

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed.In machine learning, algorithms are 'trained' to find patterns and features in massive amounts of data in order to make decisions and predictions based on new data. The better the algorithm, the more accurate the decisions and predictions will become as it processes more data.

### How machine learning works

Step 1: Select and prepare a training data set
Step 2: Choose an algorithm to run on the training data set
Step 3: Training the algorithm to create the model
Step 4: Using and improving the model
